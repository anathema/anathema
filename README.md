1. Run ``gradlew idea`` to create the IDEA project files.
2. Import the project into IDEA.

Run ``gradlew buildZip``. Done.

### Building a Windows installer ###
> This will only work on Windows.

1. Install [NSIS](http://nsis.sourceforge.net/Download "Our installer-framework of choice").

3. In either your home directory or your clone of anathema, append a property ``nsis_path`` to ``gradle.properties``. Make it point to the NSIS folder, e.g. ``nsis_path=C:/dev/NSIS``.
4. Run ``gradlew buildWindowsInstaller``.
